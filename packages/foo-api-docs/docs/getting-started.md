# Getting Started

[Foo](https://www.foo.software) provides a provides a [REST API](/docs/api/endpoints) a corresponding [Node.js API client](/docs/api-client) and [CLI](/docs/api-cli) to manage pages and Lighthouse audits programmatically.

- Create an account on [Foo](https://www.foo.software/register). You can create a basic account for free and even use the API!
- Add "pages" via [Foo's dashboard](https://www.foo.software/register) to run Lighthouse against.
- Familiarize yourself with the dashboard from above by clicking around and manually triggering Lighthouse audits. By doing this, it might become apparent how Foo runs Lighthouse audits based on pages defined by the user and establishes a queue to do so.
- Find your API token in your [account page on Foo](https://www.foo.software/account) as you'll need it to [authenticate requests](/docs/api/authentication) with our API.
